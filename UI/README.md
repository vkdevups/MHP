# Weather App

Design a weather dashboard on a smart device like smartphone or tablet. On start, the dashboard should build up from a blank page. Use micro animations to reveal the dashboard elements. Provide a point of interaction! By tapping on a content element, the user can enlarge and decrease further details about a specific information.

__Screens should include:__
- location, date and time
- the current & estimated temperature of the day
- a wheather forecast for the following week
- feel free to include more information
